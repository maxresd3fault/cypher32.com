							<p><img class="image-right-nb" src="/images/Y2K_Logo.webp" alt="Y2K_Logo.webp" width="200" height="140"/>I created this site to practice my HTML and CSS. There is a little JavaScript too, but altogether this is a fairly simplistic website. I've created websites in the past on WordPress and whatnot, but I had never fully dove into web programming. So creating this site was a challenge for me to program something without using visual editors.</p>
							<p>My favorite decade by far is the 2000's so it was fitting to pick that as an aesthetic for this site. In my opinion nothing beats the old skeuomorphic designs of the past two decades. For example iOS 6, the GNOME 2 desktop environment, classic websites, and more. These designs run far and few in today's landscape of flat boring interfaces, so why not add to the mix?</p>

							<p>You'll find some cool stuff here! I do a lot of photography as a hobby so you can look at that page to see my past and current work. I'll also post things occasionally on here such as projects I'm working on, opinion pieces, random thoughts, and more. If that sounds interesting to you, stick around. For all intensive purposes, this is a blog with a few extra things.</p>

							<p>Since this is a personal website you should take anything you read or see on here with a grain of salt. This website is going to be biased and I will post some opinionated content. Feel free to send an email to provide your thoughts, but please understand what this website is and isn't. This isn't a news source, this isn't supposed to tell you what to think, this is simply my thoughts and ideas in a bunch of unorganized HTML.</p>
							<p>In addition, please <em>DO NOT</em> view this website on cellphones. It will work, but it will look terrible. This website was not designed for phones, and was built using design language from before they even existed.</p>
