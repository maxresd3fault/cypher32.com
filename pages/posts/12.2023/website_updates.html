							<p>This is a fairly simple website: just some HTML files, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript to make some things easier. However when I started making this website I was fairly new to all these languages. However, my knowledge has grown a lot in the last year. So in revisiting this project I want to make some much needed changes to the site.</p>
							<p>Most of these changes will revolve around making the site load faster for you, and making it easier to edit for me. Here's a list of some changes already implemented today:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Optimized images: smaller file sizes, most images converted from .png and .jpg into the much more efficient .webp format.</li>
								<li>Cleaned up code: fixed bugs in the code, optimized it for HTML5 and more modern browsers, and properly formatted it to make it easier on myself.</li>
								<li>Site UI updates: tweaked the site's UI and fonts, made things look better across various browsers and operating systems.</li>
								<li>Mobile updates: the site is now functional on mobile, and loads properly. However I still don't recommend using it on mobile.</li>
								<li>All new <a href="/music.html">Music</a> page: just a list of music I like (click on an album to be taken to where you can listen to it), I'll periodically add new albums to this.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Absolutely nothing. These changes are obviously all server side, this post is here just to tell you about them. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the updates and changes. However if you are experiencing issues you might need to reset your cache and/or cookies for this site.</p>
