							<p>Coffee is a big part of a lot of people's days. Especially for me, I've been drinking coffee for as long as I can remember. Some people tell you it stunts your growth (they're wrong), some people say it's healthy, some people will even go as far to say it will help you live longer (in moderation... I think). But one thing is for certain: people drink it regardless, and a lot.</p>
							<p>I've become pretty numb to caffeine, so from what I can tell it doesn't seem to have a huge affect on me anymore. In fact I don't get headaches or suffer any adverse effects if I don't drink it, maybe just slightly more groggy waking up. For me it's almost more of a habit, and I do enjoy the taste.</p>

							<p>Let's go back to our original problem. A lot of people take their coffee seriously. I'd say I'm in the middle, I don't like bad coffee but I'm not looking to make it perfect. A problem arises when you're away from your normal coffee maker. Coffee is one of the most marked up commodities out there, and people pay for it. When you buy a Starbucks you're mostly paying for the brand, and of course there are cheaper options but regardless cafes most of the time are fairly pricey.</p>
							<p>Instant coffee is my solution! Now a lot of people probably know the quality of instant coffee isn't exactly the best, but there are ones out there that hold up. My favorite is the Japanese UCC line of instant coffees. Now this can be a little hard to get your hands on in the West, but if you can definitely try it.</p>
							<p>Where I live <a target="_blank" href="https://ucc-apac.com/en-ap/our-products/">there are a few different blends offered</a>:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>113 - "From more than 500 kinds of taste blending expertise, the taste of bitterness is carefully selected."</li>
								<li>114 - "Premium blend perfected to deliver a soft, mellow satisfaction."</li>
								<li>117 - "Premium blend perfected to serve a well-rounded flavour."</li>
								<li>118 - "From more than 500 kinds of taste blending expertise, the perfect taste and aroma is carefully selected."</li>
								<li>Special - "From more than 500 kinds of taste blending expertise, the taste of bitterness is carefully selected."</li>
								<li>Craftsman's Coffee - "Crafted and freshly roasted for a rich signature aroma and bittersweet flavours."</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Now personally I have only tried the 114 and 117 blends, but I am wanting to try the others. They come in a nice glass container, have a really good smell, and surprisingly rich taste. Compared to all the other instant coffee I've ever tried this is by far the best. All of them are also unsweetened and uncreamed, so if you like black coffee this is for you. It also gives you the option to use real sugar and milk and not whatever fake creamer and sweetener is in a lot of other instant coffees.</p>
