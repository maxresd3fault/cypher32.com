							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/4.2024/maxres/geforce6.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/4.2024/geforce6.webp" alt="geforce6.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>From the 90’s to the end of the 2000’s most graphics cards came with some very interesting eye catching artwork printed on their boxes and coolers. Why? Well I don’t know, it seems to fit the aesthetic of the time and to make the things look cool so people would buy them. The same RGB lights sell a lot of PC parts today, this art would have been one of the next best things before RGB became a mainstream feature. I mean just take a look at this GeForce 6 (to the right) with a mermaid printed on it.</p>
							<p>I feel like another reason this practice was popular is because when PC gaming started becoming a big deal in the 90’s and computing power was growing every year, these cards went from really not being able to render a whole lot to being able to look pretty decent. So the 3D rendered box art might be trying to show the buyer, “hey look how our card <em>can</em> look”. Big emphasis on can, because a 3D render is a lot different from a game running in real time. These pictures on the cards are also very smooth, aka a lot of antialiasing and texture filtering. Something a lot of games at the time wouldn't use as much because it’s expensive to use those features.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/4.2024/maxres/hd4890.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/posts/4.2024/hd4890.webp" alt="hd4890.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>I think a lot of these designs went away going into the 2010’s for a few reasons, mainly the design language changed with a huge shift from skeuomorphic 3D designs to a more flat design language. A good example would be how Windows 7 looks compared to 8/10, or the transition from iOS 6 to 7. So it makes sense graphics card manufactures got rid of their very 3D art on the boxes and cards to fit in with the new trend. And the other reason is because by the 2010’s PC gamers were adjusted to the power of newer cards and being able to render more complicated games, I mean Crysis came out in 2007. So by this point a 3D render of a girl, or a wizard, or a monster whatever, was somewhat unnecessary to entice people to buy a card. Most people are going to be doing a lot of premeditated research on graphics cards anyway because it’s a large investment. It’s not exactly the kind of thing where you walk into a computer store and pick the coolest looking one off the shelf. However this is all just my speculations.</p>
							<p>In conclusion I think these designs look pretty cool, and they are pretty fun. Personally I’m fairly indifferent to RGB, and I think a box like this would look pretty cool on the shelf. However when the graphics card is actually in the computer I don’t think you’ll be seeing much of the design on the cooler. I don’t think these designs will come back any time soon, but maybe one day they will find their way back into modern design language, and then we could have cool GPU boxes once again. The picture might not cause me to buy a $500 card, but it sure would make me feel a lot better about it having a cool box.</p>
