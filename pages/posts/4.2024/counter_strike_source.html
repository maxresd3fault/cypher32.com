CS:S isn’t exactly the most praised game in the franchise. But to me, it has this inexplicable charm to it. I also like the fact it’s running on the Source engine, I personally have a lot more technical experience with the Source engine than GoldSrc which CS 1.6 (the predecessor of this game) runs on. One of my favorite things about these older CS games is the custom maps. One of my favorite custom maps, <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/101626" target="_blank">de_corse</a>, is pictured to the right. There is just something about the quality of the community maps for CS:S that is beyond me. Like seriously, someone could tell me some of the community maps are official from Valve and I wouldn’t have ever known they weren’t. CS 1.6 also has a wealth of community maps too of course!</p>

Valve has no official servers for the older CS games making them mostly independent, so as long as people host servers people can play the game. When my friends and I play I always host my own private server for us all on my Linux server. I load it up with a ton of custom maps and Source Mod with some plugins. We’ve made a lot of fun memories in this game, and one of the reasons it is fun is because of its quirks. One thing about CS:S compared to other CS games is the head hit boxes are a lot bigger, making it easier to get headshots. This can be fun and infuriating at the same time. The physics in the Source engine and movement are also very fun, bunny hopping and surfing are huge in CS:S. Gun game servers are also very plentiful with tons of players to this day. You can also still play the game competitively via <a href="https://war-lords.net/pugs" target="_blank">WarLords</a>, they’re an old server network that still runs PUG’s to this day.</p>

							<p>The current state of Counter Strike is iffy at best, most people are not thrilled with the state of CS2 and it is certainly a blast to game preservation that CS:GO has been removed from Steam. But despite all that we still have access to CS 1.6 And CS:S. And CS:S is turning 20 this October! It was released in 2004 alongside Half-Life 2 as Valve’s flagship multiplayer game, but as we know with mixed reception. Despite its faults I embrace them, and I’ve had a lot of fun playing this game casually with friends and making maps for it. Most people also already own this game, because most Garry’s Mod maps use the CS:S assets, so owning this game is basically a soft requirement for playing GMod. I recommend you give the game a try! There’s plenty of fun community servers of all game modes, or you can always try hosting your own.</p>
