							<p>I decided I was spending too much time on my iPhone when I would go out of the house and I wanted to do more than just set screen time limits (which everyone just ignores anyway). I combined this desire with my love for retro tech and purchased a flip phone. But not just any flip phone, one from 2023. Yes that’s right, new flip phones are still made. However mine is a little complicated. You see, there are a few things I just <em>need</em> my phone to be able to do.</p>

It is the Kyocera KY-42C. Despite it being a flip phone, it is running full Android 10. If you have a keen eye you might have noticed the Japanese hiragana symbols on the T9 keypad in the picture above. If you did, nice, if not that simply means this is a Japanese phone. I imported it brand new straight from Japan. Now, they do still sell new flip phones in America and other countries too, so why one from Japan?</p>
							<p>Well that’s a good question, and the reason is this phone is just better. Kyocera themselves sell a few phones in the US, and even CAT makes a flip phone (yes the construction company, shown to the right). But you might see where this is going, these phones in the US are mostly targeted towards construction and industrial workers where they need a durable and reliable phone that won’t crack when they drop it. Whereas my Kyocera is targeted to the average consumer (or old person). From what I can tell, flip phones are also just fairly popular in Japan. I might be wrong but this is just what I glean from some digging online.</p>
							<p>Now about this phone, although it is running Android 10 it does not come pre installed with Google Mobile Services (GMS) or the Google Play Store. Now depending on the kind of person you are, this is either a benefit or a disadvantage. For me, this is a benefit! It’s a great way to distance yourself from both Apple and Google with your phone, without rooting a more mainstream Android phone. Now Kyocera of course installs some of their own stuff on here, and this phone was originally sold through a carrier called Docomo so they also have some stuff on here, but you can actually remove it easily if you’d like. Now nothing would stop you from installing GMS and Google Play yourself but really I don’t see why you would want to do that.</p>
							<p>To be honest this phone is also not the fastest, installing GMS would really slow it down. What I have done is sideloaded the bare minimum of apps I need and just a few I want to have. For example: Discord, Line (a messaging app used in Asia), and the Reuters news app. Now if you have ever played around with Android and rooting before you will know most apps stop sending push notifications without GMS. Well there are a few workarounds, the most popular is to use <a href="https://microg.org/" target="_blank">microG</a> Services which is a very good open source implementation. I don’t know too much so I won’t get too technical. However, for whatever reason I just could not get this to work with my Line app. And having push notifications for that is something I need. So I tried something a bit less ideal: a program called <a href="https://gboxlab.com/" target="_blank">GBox</a> which from my knowledge sandboxes GMS into almost a VM or container like thing and then runs your apps with that. Again I don’t really know the specifics of how this works and won’t try to explain it. But it does work.</p>

					<h1>What I Think</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>I think this is a very good phone for me. I bought it a few months ago so I’ve been using it for a while now before writing this. It won’t replace everything, and I’m not throwing out my iPhone (I just don’t bring it with me anymore). All my banking apps are still on my iPhone for example. You will also be giving up taking effortless casual photos with your phone, for me I bring a real camera with me a lot of the time so it’s not a huge deal. Battery life is great, it’s durable, and definitely a head turner. It is fast enough for using it for texting, calling, reading the news, etc. But don’t expect to be watching any videos or playing any games. The T9 keypad also takes some time to get used to but it has predictive text input for English and learns the words you type so it could be worse - the tactile feel is really nice.</p>
							<p>Now there are some risks when buying a foreign phone, actually quite a few. And I don’t recommend going out and buying a Japanese phone without knowing what you’re doing as it can be risky. You have to obviously check if the phone is unlocked to a Japanese carrier or not, you have to see if the cell bands are compatible with your country's carrier, and you have to make sure your own carrier doesn’t have a whitelist for which phones they allow on their network. So it’s quite the daunting list of things to watch out for. I triple checked all these things before I bought it and looked at other people who have imported the same model of phone, so I am good to use it in America.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, if you really want to get serious about spending less time on your phone and want to look cool while doing it this is certainly a good option. If you’re less tech savvy, just buy one of the US region phones. The CAT one I mentioned before still runs full Android for example. I accomplished my goal and I do spend a lot less time on a screen when I’m out and about and I really haven't had any problems with the phone.
