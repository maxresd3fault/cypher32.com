							<em>Contains spoilers.</em>
							<p>Recently I took to rewatching the four original Alien movies with Sigourney Weaver. Although I wish there were only three... Alien feels like one of those franchises where the executives don't know when enough is enough, multiple unneeded sequels after the first three movies, quite a few bad video games, etc. However, the first two sequals are the exception to this.</p>
							<p>One thing that makes the first three movies so good is that they are all different while still being familiar to each other. The first is a moody suspense/horror film, the second is an exciting action film that just keeps going when you think its about to wind down, and finally the third is an amazing philosophical drama on death and morality. All these movies shine in their own right and are paced quite differently. But then the fourth, comes along and just throws all that out the window.</p>

					<h1>Alien</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/11.2025/MU-TH-ER.webp" alt="MU-TH-ER.webp" width="200" height="125"/>The original film and cult classic which most people have seen. In my opinion, this film is by far the best looking out of the four despite it being the oldest. The entire movie used live action animatronics and practical effects which look far superior to some of the screen effects used in the later movies. Aside from visual effects the set pieces of this film are iconic. With the retro-futuristic vision of the future. The gritty halls of the Nostromo, the lit up buttons dotting the walls of the MU-TH-UR control room, and the CRT displays all over the ship.</p>
							<p>The reveal of Ash, the synthetic android, being an enemy is great. Trying to help 'the company' bring the Alien back for research. The members of the crew getting slowly picked off leaving just Ripley and the cat at the end. And once it is just her left, the silence of no one talking to each other really adds to the experience.</p>

					<h1>Aliens</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/11.2025/alien-queen.webp" alt="alien-queen.webp" width="200" height="125"/>Aliens is a great sequel that does a very good job of making an action movie, a bit of a far cry from the slower suspense oriented original. Aliens doesn't overdo it, or underdo it. The new synthetic android introduced, Bishop, is a great new character. We are weary of him from the beginning, remembering how Ash turned out in the first movie, so it is a pleasant surprise when he turns out to be one of the biggest allies in the film.</p>
							<p>This movie again has much of our cast get slowly picked off as well, which adds to the suspense and action. The action is also well paced with quieter moments taken to add to suspense and character development.</p>
							<p>The reveal of the alien queen at the end is also quite thrilling, and the battle between her and Ripely back on the orbiting space ship is extremely well done.</p>

					<h1>Alien³</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/11.2025/alien3.webp" alt="alien3.webp" width="200" height="125"/>Alien 3 really changes up the previous formula, its a far slower paced movie focusing more on characters and the relationships between them. Ripley crash lands on a male only penal colony planet, setting up the film to have a very interesting dynamic. This movie is dark, very dark, it deals with themes of rape, desolation, death of children, suicide, etc. But all of these topics are explored in interesting and meaningful ways.</p>
							<p>Another thing I like about this movie is that they killed off one of the main characters just before halfway through. This really catches you off guard as you'd assume the main characters getting the most screen time would live til the end.</p>
							<p>This movie is not everyone's favorite, and it is very very different compared to the other ones. But it is really good at what it is trying to accomplish.</p>

					<h1>Alien: Resurrection</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/11.2025/alien4.webp" alt="alien4.webp" width="200" height="125"/>And this is where things start to fall apart. I really am surprised Sigourney Weaver even agreed to do a movie like this. Some lines in the script are so ridiculous and weird I'm shocked they even got her to say them.</p>
							<p>The premise of this movie is not bad, it revolves around what if the bad guys did get ahold of the alien. However the execution is just off the walls. Too many characters, all of which are quite shallow and half have no reason to be in the movie, extremely poorly written dialog, very out-there choices such as having aliens talk to each other, and it goes on. A very young and pretty Winona Ryder is in the movie playing an android, but alas just like most things she is in, she comes off as extremely annoying and unlikeable when here it seems the script intended the opposite.</p>
							<p>I have no idea how this film actually got green-lit. It feels like wasted potential because again, the premise is not bad, just everything else is. Don't even get me started on the half alien half human alien.</p>
