					<h1>Unified Operating Systems</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>The release of Apple's new iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, etc, is imminent (Sep 15th). These operating systems mark the biggest visual overhaul Apple has done since the iOS 7 era; and one of the key goals is to unify the visual experience across the product line. The naming scheme has also been unified, now following a trend in the auto industry by naming the current versions after the year.</p>
							<p>The thing with Apple is they are very much a trend setter in the entire tech space, when Apple makes a visual change like this other companies will follow suit. Just like after iOS 7 many companies also adopted a flatter simpler look for their products and brands. Even some websites have already adopted a Liquid Glass inspired design, like YouTube. So, whether you like it or not expect to see it in many places.</p>
							<p>Personally, I am a huge fan of Apple's "Liquid Glass", I think this design brings a lot of life to the software and it is much more than a simple blur effect, like Windows Aero boiled down to. Apple is truly simulating how glass actually refracts light. Whether we're about to experience another Windows Vista disaster, of older computers and devices not being powerful enough to run these new visual effects, is yet to be seen. However it does seem Apple is putting in considerable effort into optimization and reducing energy consumption in this new software to mainly maximize the battery life of its new iPhone Air, which will talk about later.</p>
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/9.2025/camera-icons.webp" alt="camera-icons.webp" width="200" height="125"/>Digital design has felt dead for about the past decade. No inspiration, no life, just flat boring minimalistic designs. It feels like Apple is bringing back some of the soul that can be found in beloved design styles like Frutiger Aero. And that is something I am completely behind. Although I'm not a fan of every decision for this new software. For example, I think making the menu bar on macOS translucent is questionable at best, thankfully it has been confirmed in the betas that there is an option to disable this. Some of the new icons I love, but others I feel like are worse than the old ones. For example I love the new camera icon shown to the right, but I'm not so much of a fan of the new Automator icon.</p>
							<p>Overall I am quite excited for the release of this software, in my eyes Liquid Glass is a gorgeous design full of life and character. My hope would be that this reignites a trend of skeuomorphic design across the industry. Obviously all this new software introduces many new functional features aside from just the visual overhaul, but many of these things I find to be of not huge significance to my own needs and I won't cover them here.</p>

					<h1>iPhone Air</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/9.2025/maxres/iphone-air.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/posts/9.2025/iphone-air.webp" alt="iphone-air.webp" width="200" height="125"/></a>This one I find kind of strange. I don't really see what the market for the new iPhone Air is aside from a niche gimmick. Yes it is impressive Apple managed to make an iPhone 5.64mm thin, but what is the purpose? The device is quite large aside from its thinness with a 6.5 inch screen, which I feel like defeats the point of having a small/thin device (like the iPhone mini). Not only that, but it is also $200 more expensive than the base model iPhone 17, all while having a smaller battery, a worse camera system, and no SIM card slot (depending on your region). And all of that is not even to mention the far superior (and somewhat overkill) iPhone 17 Pro is only $100 more than the Air. </p>
							<p>Considering all of that, I really don't see the market for this device. I feel like ideally Apple should have brought back the iPhone mini, and then just made that thinner and offered it at around the same price as the base iPhone 17. However, miniaturization is not cheap, and having a mini and thin iPhone would have even more battery problems. The thing is I don't believe Apple's "pro" users care about size or thinness, and Apple also understands this! This is perfectly shown in the much thicker heavier MacBook Pros, which only a matter of years ago Apple was trying to miniaturize and make thinner at the expense of features. Apple realized their pro users do not care for this and now we have bigger devices with better keyboards, cooling, batteries, etc.</p>
							<p>In addition, if a user puts a case or the portable MagSafe battery on this phone it's going to end up just being around same thickness as the regular iPhone 17 anyway. In my opinion this is not worth the up-charge, and I don't think the iPhone Air will last for very long, just like the mini died off quick.</p>

					<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>A lot has been coming out of Apple these past few months. Some good, some weird. I'm quiet excited for their new generation of operating systems, and confused about the point of the new iPhone. However, despite this new phone being somewhat aimless, I still think it is good Apple is trying new things. For the past few iPhone generations everything has basically been the same with hardly any innovation or risk taking. The iPhone Air is certainly a risk, it probably won't sell well, but at least it's something new.</p>
