							<em>Contains minor spoilers.</em>
							<p>This is one of the most thought provoking books I’ve read in a long time. I find the themes of the story to be a meld of Brave New World plus the movie Gattaca and some. Although this book is science fiction, it also incorporates many aspects of fantasy. It does a really good job of blending these two genres.</p>
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/8.2024/ships.webp" alt="ships.webp" width="200" height="125">Glory Season is a novel answering the "what if?" question. In this case: what if humans operated on a seasonal mating system in a female dominated society. Much similar to deer, almost year round there are more doe per buck and most people know deer also operate on a seasonal mating cycle. However in addition to this idea, cloning is also thrown into the mix. All of this creates the foundation for a complex society very foreign to us that the author, David Brin, is then able to explore throughout the near 800 pages of my mass market paperback copy.</p>
							<p>This is by no means a short book but it was well worth my time and constantly leaves you thinking and pondering the ideas laid down. The planet inhabited by this society is called Stratos, an isolated world where humans were placed by a set of founders including a woman named Lysos. This was not a naturally evolved system, but rather an artificially engineered one. History is a garbled topic for the inhabitants of Stratos, most aren’t fully aware of how long humans have really lived on the planet or how their society came to be, but they all see Lysos as a god like being.</p>
							<p>There are three main social classes found on this fictional planet:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Winter children: who are clones born in the winter. This is the highest and most respected class.</li>
								<li>Summer children: otherwise known as "vars" (short for variants), who are conceived and born naturally.</li>
								<li>Males: of which none are clones. In this society the males tend to sail the numerous ships of Stratos and rarely live inland. The males become docile in the winter and rut in the summer. They are effectively banished to the sea as to not become a nuisance to the much more vast female population of the planet.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Females all belong to a clan which specializes in a specific area of trade, for example blacksmithing. One reason why clones are so valued in this world is because not only are the clone offspring of a clan taught how to specialize in that field, but their physical characteristics can be perfectly tweaked throughout generations for it. The vars are denied this and thus tend to settle for more mundane labor or wander hoping to find their own niche.</p>
							<p>The society of Stratos is filled with different political groups all with their own opinions and ideas and prejudices. But the common theme seems to be that vars and males face constant oppression no matter where they go. In my opinion this book is a critique of both radical feminism and toxic masculinity. However that is not conclusive, the book lays down this society for the reader and leaves this up for interpretation. In Brin’s excerpt at the end of the book he says so himself "I penned Stratos Colony as neither utopia nor dystopia." However in my own opinion I find it to be quite dystopian, just like the fictional inhabitants of this world find the idea of an equal gender ratio and "old world" society to be dystopian.</p>
							<p>Without spoiling much, the book revolves around the adventures of a var child seeking to find work. But this plan quickly gets turned on its head as our protagonist gets involved in events that will define the future of her world. This book is constantly throwing twists at you, each chapter will leave you thinking about not just the book’s society but our own too, and is truly something unique. I highly recommend it if you have the time.</p>
