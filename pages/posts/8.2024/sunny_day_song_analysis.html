							<p>"Sunny Day" is the 7th song on the album "Humanistic" by Abandoned Pools. The band was founded by Tommy Walter who was also one of the founding members of Eels. Humanistic was released in 2001 as Walter’s first solo album, with help from other musicians in producing and backing vocals. A lot of people might recognize this album from the TV series "Clone High" by MTV, where a lot of the songs from this album make an appearance. However I have personally never watched the show.</p>

						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>This entire album is really good, and there are many other songs on it I like a lot such as "Suburban Muse", "Ruin Your Life", and "Never" just to name a few. I would recommend listening to the whole thing. But Sunny Day stands out to me because of its lyrics.</p>
							<p>This album was released over 20 years ago but I feel like this song speaks to a lot of issues very prevalent today. But of course you can interpret the lyrics however you like, and that is the beauty of (good) music.</p>
							<p>The song starts off with the lines "Hiding inside a crowd, My head is inside a cloud, Go where the music’s loud, And all these talking heads are blurred in violet hues". The last line of the opening verse is a little ambiguous, but I interpret the first few lines as a perfect analogy for ignorance. I’m sure most people have met someone they would consider to be "Hiding inside a crowd", and this line alone can be applied in many ways. Maybe in the literal sense, or maybe as in following trends and trying to fit in with other people. The next line "My head is inside a cloud" I think also refers to ignorance, shying away from problems and the real world. And then "Go where the music’s loud" I think again follows this theme, trying to fit in, blend in with other people, and be distracted by what is really going on around you. 20 years ago this was probably not the intended meaning, however, I think this is a perfect analogy for phones specifically. People being lost inside their devices and spending hours and hours scrolling through short form videos and on social media trying to fit in with meaningless trends.</p>
							<p>The chorus is fairly simple and is comprised of Walter singing "Another sunny day". And I just take this a face value, I think it literally means nice days passing by, being wasted.</p>
							<p>"She doesn't know wrong from right, She doesn't know when to fight, She only knows that tonight there's always someone out there, She'll never be alone". In this verse there is obviously some frustration aimed at the girl. But that aside the line that stands out to me is "She only knows that tonight there's always someone out there, She'll never be alone". Again, probably not the intended meaning 20 years ago, but today with dating apps this is a reality. There is always someone out there. And a lot of people are like this, they want/need to be with someone all of the time either with friends or in this case I think it is referring to a hook up. And while this isn’t inherently bad, too much of anything can be bad. The less alone time we as people have, the less time we have with our own thoughts and to reflect on our decisions and lives. To make things worse, even if you do happen to be alone in our modern world, you probably spend a lot of that time being distracted on a digital device opposed to being with your thoughts.</p>
							<p>The chorus evolves by adding "Come on, Get out", echoing the message to leave behind all of the nonsense and distractions of our world and just go outside.</p>
							<p>We then have a short bridge that consists of what sounds like an ad or someone on a radio saying "You can serve God and Man, No more effectively than by getting rich". I think this is just a nod at how much of a role money plays in our lives. And how much it can affect our decisions and relationships.</p>
							<p>The third verse is a bit more up for interpretation. "Get off the bathroom floor, Daddy's not here no more, I'm showing you to the door, Enough of always numb and always insecure". I think in a literal sense Walter is probably referring to someone on drugs. "Daddy's not here no more", I interpret as the people in the song are full grown adults but still suffer from these profound problems. "Enough of always numb and always insecure", just meaning using drugs (or even phones and people) to hide away from your feelings. And it seems to be a lot of people that need to do these things are inherently insecure about something. Whatever it is, using drugs, or scrolling social media on a phone, it does numb your feelings.</p>
							<p>Verse four repeats verse one but flips the words "cloud" and "crowd" and then adds "And all this talk of rock-stars really makes me sick". This line really hits home for me, talk of popular people, idols, and pop stars really does make <em>me</em> sick. I will never understand how some people will spend so much time following a specific person and trying to learn every little detail about them and try to be like them. There is a line to be drawn of course, there is a difference between liking a famous person and idolizing everything about them. I like some famous people, but not to the extent as a lot of fans. In my opinion a lot of popular figures, especially in music, aren’t very good people nor very good at what they do. Modern mainstream pop music especially has been on a decline for decades, musically less complex, lyrically designed to be more relatable, and overall less thought provoking. The exact opposite of this song, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on from a musical standpoint, and the lyrics are bold and extremely captivating.</p>
							<p>The song finishes off with one last chorus repeating "Another sunny day, Come on, Get out". A plea for listeners to put aside all the bullshit thrown in our faces in this modern society and to simply go outside and enjoy the weather. I think this is a very powerful song. Even though it isn’t my favorite song, it is a song I think about a lot and lyrically might be my favorite. Of course this is my interpretation and I’m sure other people have very different interpretations of it, in fact a lot of what I said Tommy Walter probably would have never even imaged in 2001. But again, that is the beauty of music written in this way.</p>
