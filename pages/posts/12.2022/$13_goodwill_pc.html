							<h2>$13 Goodwill PC</h2>

							<p>Despite the dust, it can be quite robust. This post takes a look at a cheap office computer I found at goodwill and what I did with it.</p>

					<h1>Really?</h1>

							<p>I've never seen my local Goodwill have a computer ever. Something to do with data/privacy concerns. They used to send computers to the outlet store, but they even stopped doing that a few years ago.</p>
							<p>I believe they send computers and most other valuable items to their online auction website, where it will sell for more money obviously.</p>
							<p>So I was very surprised to go in the other day and actually see an old office machine (HP Compaq Elite 8300 SFF) sitting on the shelf there, let alone for $13. So of course I took it even though I didn't need it.</p>

							<p>So after wiping it I dusted it out and put on some new thermal paste. Surprisingly there wasn't too much dust. I threw in some extra sticks of DDR3 RAM I had laying around bringing it to a total of 12GB, then updated the BIOS to the latest version from 2019.</p>
							<p>Lastly, I installed a minimal headless installation of Debian so I could use this thing as a small server and it works great. I've been running a small Minecraft server on it for the past few days now.</p>
							<p>You can see its specs in the image to the right, I recommend clicking on it to zoom in. Overall a pretty good find for $13, the RAM in the system alone is worth close to $20.</p>
