							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/1.2024/maxres/lonely_mountain.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/1.2024/lonely_mountain.webp" alt="lonely_mountain.webp" width="200" height="125"/></a>I feel like the message of The Hobbit really embraces the above quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The story is about a closed minded individual seeing more of the world and changing his opinions and thoughts all while growing stronger both physically and mentally. While the ending of the book focuses on a dilemma of treasure and who should hold the rights to it: the lineage of people that inherit it, or should some of it be given to people who directly suffered in its assertation. The book deals with some interesting thought provoking situations and the characters' reactions feel genuine and real.</p>
							<p>But back to the quote, the majority of the book is about the characters' struggles and journey to their final destination (the treasure). And even though at first glance it seems their biggest hardship will come at the end, an evil powerful dragon guarding the treasure, I feel like their greatest struggles were in the middle of the book. The main character, Bilbo, starts out very closed minded and has never really left his home. He opposes going on this adventure until he is practically forced into it. The group of travelers faces a lot of challenges right from the start, and Bilbo must adapt quickly in order to survive, even with the help of his companions.</p>
							<p>So I feel like a huge part of this book is about Bilbo's growth as a person. And that growth is made very clear throughout their journey, he becomes more daring, more confident, more capable and powerful. And he ends up saving his companions a few times. And at the very end Bilbo realizes he doesn't care much for the treasure, I feel like this really goes to show his growth. He feels like he gained more from the experience of this adventure than the final reward.</p>

							<p>The book is suitable both for younger audiences and more mature ones too. It's written in a playful tone at times while still being serious. It does deal with heavier themes and dilemmas which make it interesting and hard to put down. Starting in 2012 this book was adapted into a live action film trilogy, and the movies are very good and how I was first exposed to Tolkien.</p>
							<p>I read the newly released 2023 illustrated version, and I would recommend this edition as it includes a lot of Tolkien's previously published illustrations, however this is the first time they have ever been included in the book.</p>
