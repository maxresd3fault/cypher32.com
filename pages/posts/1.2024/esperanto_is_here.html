							<em>Before I start this post, I am still learning Esperanto and not fluent. Although I try my best in my translations, they might not be perfect. Please send an email if you notice a mistake.</em>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/1.2024/maxres/zamenhof.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/1.2024/zamenhof.webp" alt="zamenhof.webp" width="125" height="192"/></a>Esperanto is a really fascinating language, it was created by L. L. Zamenhof (pictured to the right) in 1887. Zamenhof grew up in an area of Europe surrounded by all sorts of different languages, and he loved them. He was a polyglot speaking Russian, German, French, Polish, Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. However this abundance of languages around him wasn't always the best thing in his eyes.</p>
							<p><em>"I was brought up as an idealist; I was taught that all people were brothers, while outside in the street at every step I felt that there were no people, only Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews and so on."</em> -L. L. Zamenhof, 1895 (quoted from a letter he wrote to Nikolai Borovko).</p>
							<p>Zamenhof, a very passionate man, decided enough was enough and he was going to try to solve this problem. This is when he decided to create Esperanto. He envisioned a world where everyone would speak two languages, their native one, and then Esperanto. He designed Esperanto to be extremely easy to learn, here's a quick (incomplete) list of reasons why it's so easy:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>All nouns end in "o".</li>
								<li>All verbs have the same conjugation.</li>
								<li>The writing is phonetic.</li>
								<li>Words follow a prefix and suffix system; once you learn those and some root words the amount of words you can make grows to a staggering amount.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Well a lot of people today still don't know what Esperanto is, while it did not achieve its original goal I would not say it failed either. In fact Esperanto has had a massive impact on our world still and was almost adopted by the UN (being vetoed by one country). It is estimated that upwards of 2 million people speak the language today, with around 1,000 native speakers (yes native).</p>
							<p>And that is why Esperanto is coming to this site, a lot of people from all over the world speak it as a second language and they might not speak English. It is also just a hobby of mine, I like the language and want to challenge myself by translating this website. The new language selector is at the top of the site above the page buttons.</p>
