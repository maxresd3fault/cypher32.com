							<p>The Depths of Time is a Sci-Fi novel published in 2000 by Roger MacBride Allen. It uses some very well thought out concepts, but it suffers from these concepts not being emphasized enough throughout the story.</p>

							<em>Contains minor spoilers.</em>
							<p>In this interstellar future envisioned by MacBride, humans have devised a unique solution to the lack of light speed travel: "timeshafts". These timeshafts allow a spacecraft to travel through time. The timeshafts are regulated by the Chronologic Patrol, their main job being to prevent paradoxes, and to never let anyone from the past see events of the future. Only special spaceships with cryogenic technology can use these timeshafts. These ships float through space at painfully slow speeds getting close to their destination, then they travel through one of the timeshafts to arrive back in the time which they started their journey. The end result being a trip which took the ship possibly 100's of years, but when the passengers on board awake it will have only been a few years time. It is quite an interesting and plausible idea, certainly more believable than Star Trek's warp travel.</p>
							<p>The book starts out by thrusting the reader into an epic space battle with one of the timeshafts being attacked. We are introduced to the book's main character, Anton Koffield, who is the commander of one of the Chronologic Patrol ships defending the timeshaft. The unknown attackers ultimately prevail in this battle and Koffield is left with no choice but to permanently close the timeshaft, a decision with far reaching consequences which follow him throughout the book. Koffield's ship was guarding the future side of the timeshaft, and now that it has been closed his crew and him are stranded in the future.</p>
							<p>As I mentioned, this book has a very interesting idea of using time travel in this fashion to substitute light speed travel, but quickly after the book's opening this idea gets put on the shelf and the book turns into a pretty standard mystery novel. The mystery is interesting enough, but the middle section of the book is dragged out for far too long. This book should really be closer to 371 pages, instead of 471. Seriously, the middle part of the book is very boring and takes multiple chapters to get through a very simple set of events.</p>
							<p>The whole topic also shifts after the opening, from time travel to terraforming. Most of the remainder of the book focuses on the fact that the multiple terraformed worlds in existence are all in danger because of an inherent flaw in the terraforming process which was overlooked. The focus shifts to Koffield and his companions trying to make a difference and save the inhabitants of the terraformed worlds from their inevitable doom in this future they are stranded in.</p>
							<p>Without spoiling much, the ending is a cliff hanger, but it is an intriguing twist. This book is the first out of a three book series, I think I will eventually read the rest, but I am not jumping to do so right away. Overall the book is pretty average, but if time travel and terraforming are concepts which interest you I would recommend this book because these concepts are well thought out by MacBride.</p>
							<p>The other thing I really liked about this book was the character development, throughout the story the changes in Koffield are noticeable as he works his way through multiple challenges. His relationships with the numerous companions also feel real and genuine.</p>
