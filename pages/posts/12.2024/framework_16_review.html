							<p>After having used my Framework 16 for about six months now, I can say without a doubt it is amazing. Although it has a few quirks, the innovation in this product outweighs all the minor issues.</p>

					<h1>Owning What You Buy, by Definition</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>This laptop is hands down one of the most interesting pieces of technology I own, and it is truly a pleasure to use it. If you don't know what Framework is, they are a California based startup company focused on making repairable and upgradable laptops. Their philosophy boils down to: if you can build a desktop computer, why can't you build a laptop too?</p>
							<p>In the last decade laptops have become less and less repairable and upgradeable. Apple glues all their batteries to the chassis, Dell welds their keyboards to the deck on many models, you can all but kiss socketed ram goodbye on many laptops, and probably worst of all: the hinges. On modern laptops the hinges are one of the most common points of failure, and in many cases they are welded with plastic making them near impossible to replace.</p>
							<p>It's not just the physical hardware either, Microsoft is creating millions of pounds of e-waste with Windows 11's arbitrary system requirements to force their user base to buy new computers which they simply don't need. But that's a topic for another day.</p>
							<p>Framework aims to combat all of this, with virtually every part on the laptop being modular or replaceable (yes, even the hinges). This comes at a cost, Framework laptops are not cheap. You are paying a premium for this repairability and upgradeablity. This laptop is not for everyone, if you don't value these things, or don't use a laptop enough to justify a purchase like this, you might be better off still getting a "normal" laptop.</p>
							<p>However, the idea is that the expensive initial investment will be offset overtime because you <em>can</em> upgrade the laptop. When the hardware becomes too outdated, simply drop in a new motherboard with an Intel or AMD chip of your choice (even RISC-V will be offered soon). Unfortunately, socketed laptop CPU's are not manufactured by anyone anymore, so replacing the entire motherboard is the only option. Regardless, upgrading the laptop you already own should save you money over time compared to buying a new laptop every couple of years. Framework has already kept their promise of releasing new motherboards for their 13 inch model, so I have no reason to doubt the same will happen for my 16 inch model.</p>

					<h1>The Good</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><a target="_blank" href="https://frame.work/products/16-graphics-module-amd-radeon-rx-7700s"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/12.2024/7700S.webp" alt="7700S.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Let's start off with probably the coolest feature of this entire device: modular graphics. The Framework 16 isn't marketed as a "gaming laptop" per se, but it can definitely suit this market. The Framework 16 also isn't the first laptop with modular graphics, nor the only one on the market currently with modular graphics, but in my opinion it is best executed on the Framework 16. There is no thermal paste involved, no messing with heat sinks or fans, just a few screws and the entire graphics module slides out of the back. The current RX 7700S graphics module is pictured to the right, this is currently what's in my machine and the only graphics module offered for the time being. While it isn't the most powerful mobile graphics card on the market currently, it suits my needs for light gaming, video editing, and so on. If you absolutely want the most power per dollar this simply isn't the machine for you. You can also order the laptop without a discrete GPU, and Framework will send you an empty shell with just some fans in it which slots into the back of the laptop, this empty shell is also slightly smaller than the 7700S and lighter of course. Some people might not need a GPU, as the integrated 780M graphics on the Ryzen CPU is still very competent.</p>
							<p>In my opinion the biggest thing this laptop has going for it is the modularity, the whole reason people would buy this in the first place. Everything is replaceable! On the Framework 16 you get six "expansion bays", where you can slot in ports of your choice, and even storage upgrades. If you don't need a headphone jack because you have Bluetooth headphones, then don't buy one! Use the slot for something else you can use. Not only is this functionally useful, but when the ports eventually do wear out or break, it is a simple tool-less repair. The same goes for the keyboard and trackpad, they can be replaced without tools and even rearranged to best suit your preferences. If you ever start learning another language, you can just buy a new keyboard from Framework and swap it out. If you don't need a numpad, you don't have to buy one. This kind of unparalleled choice really makes this laptop unique, and there is nothing else on the market quite like it.</p>
							<p>The screen is quite good. It has a resolution of 2560x1600, a refresh rate of 165Hz, and gets up to 500 nits bright. In addition, it also has a nice matte finish which makes it easier to see outside or in bright environments. At this price point, a screen like this is expected, and it meets those expectations. Personally, I would love to see Framework also offer a cheaper 1920x1200 display. I am not a fan of HiDPI (high dots per inch) screens on laptops because it invokes the need for fractional scaling (which on Linux is still kind of a mess with many desktop environments), and when playing games the GPU needs to work harder to play the game at a higher resolution. But also, I am weird, and most people do prefer the higher resolution screen. Also this website is fixed width and designed to be viewed on as low as 1024x768 screens, so the more ultra high res panels that come out the tinier and tinier my website will look. That's a problem for me in a another few years I think.</p>
							<p>The size. This is really impressive I think, the laptop is only up to 20.95mm thick (a little thinner without the discrete GPU). I am amazed they were able to cram this much modularity into a laptop this thin. Other products like the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT Reform</a> are huge! Don't get me wrong, the laptop is still big, and heavy, it is 16 inches after all. But I really do think it's an impressive feat the laptop is this elegant looking while cramming all this modularity into it. The Framework 13 is even more impressive in this regard.</p>
							<p>The trackpad is amazing. This is the best trackpad I've used on a laptop that isn't a MacBook. It is made of glass, and even though it isn't haptic like the Apple trackpads, it still feels great. Plus, if the physical buttons do ever wear out it is a tool-less repair. The trackpad is plenty big, and just overall feels great to use, and all the gestures you would want to use also work.</p>

					<h1>The Bad</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Now, it goes without saying a laptop that prioritizes modularity and repairability like the Framework is inevitably going to have some quirks. And some sacrifices do come at having this much modularity. For example, the keyboard isn't very good, I wouldn't call it bad but it is a little disappointing. But, this is the cost for having hot-swapable laptop keyboard, they had to make it thinner.</p>
							<p>The thermals are the biggest issue for me. The discrete GPU actually runs very cool, and using the GPU over the integrated graphics can help the CPU run a bit cooler, but boy does the CPU run hot. Under sustained loads it will hit 100 degrees Celsius and throttle. It is designed to do this, but I still don't like it, the general rule of thumb for most computers (laptop and desktop) is that if the CPU is running at over 80 degrees for long periods of time it can shorten its lifespan. The throttling also doesn't help performance of course. Framework has tried to mitigate this issue somewhat by using liquid metal instead of traditional thermal paste (just for the CPU). Liquid metal is solid until about 58 degrees Celsius when it then begins to melt and transfers heat much better than thermal paste. I am sure this has helped, but I am still not thrilled with the thermals. The laptop also is very loud under load, but to be fair almost all laptops with similar specs will be loud. Hopefully newer motherboards in the future will come with even better thermals, but we will have to see.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="https://frame.work/products/amd-rz616-wi-fi-6e"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/posts/12.2024/RZ616.webp" alt="RZ616.webp" width="125" height="192"></a>The Wi-Fi card isn't ideal. Because this is a certified "AMD Advantage Laptop" Framework is forced to use a MediaTek Wi-Fi card (shown to the left). MediaTek cards are known for having some issues under Linux, and not the best driver support. According to the <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Framework_Laptop_16#Wi-Fi">Arch Linux Wiki</a>, to take full advantage of this card's speed you must configure the regulatory domain. This took me a whole of five minutes to do, but I am not sure if other Linux distros will do this by default or not. Here's the ironic thing: I have had no issues with this card under Linux, all of them have been under Windows. I am dual booting this laptop, and even with the latest Framework driver package installed, this Wi-Fi card has tons of issues in Windows, and only in Windows. Every time I do a cold boot of Windows the Wi-Fi card refuses to connect to any network for a good five minutes or more. I really have no clue what could be causing this, it's clearly not a hardware issue since it works fine under Linux. But here's the other thing: it's a Framework! You can just put your own Wi-Fi card in it if the MediaTek one gives you too many issues.</p>

					<h1>The Verdict</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>It's good! It just depends on what you want out of a laptop. If you want the most powerful laptop or the most cost effective laptop for a budget, then this might not be for you. But if you want to stop having to buy a new laptop every couple years, or you're sick of not being able to fix your device, I think you would enjoy this product. It's simply the best on the market in terms of repairability combined with practicality. Even if you don't know much about computers, Framework has amazing documentation for fixing things, think of it like following instructions for a Lego set. Don't get the impression this product is only for computer geeks, companies like Apple want you to think repairing your device is dangerous and risky (a problem which they created for their own devices), Framework tells a different story.</p>
