							<p>The problem with monopolies is once they get a hold on their market, they can start to do whatever they want really. For example hiking prices, making their products worse because there is no competition to encourage them to do better, etc. This is why competition in any industry is good in our capitalist world. If there was only one shipping company, they could charge anything, not offer protection or insurance, not guarantee delivery dates, etc. That’s just one example. When there is competition in an industry the companies hold each other to a certain standard to win over the buyer. Despite the fact there is competition in the desktop OS space, mainly between Windows, Mac, and Linux (I omit Chrome OS because it is just dumbed down Linux and anyone who wants to do anything with their computer would never buy a Chromebook), Microsoft clearly has a monopoly with Windows. It’s not like there's an even split in the OS market, Microsoft clearly has the advantage here. One of the main reasons is games and software, people have been using Windows for so long switching to anything else means a lot of their already purchased games and software would no longer work and they would need to find alternatives. And Microsoft knows this, they know it is difficult to switch to a different OS, that paired with the fact they have a market monopoly they get arrogant.</p>
							<p>Microsoft thinks they can get away with really whatever they want. And if you examine the history of Windows in the last decade or so you can see them slowly pushing the boundaries of people, now culminating in the Recall feature this post is about. In 2015 Microsoft released Windows 10, they said it would be "the last version of Windows" (it wasn’t), and bundled with this version of Windows comes, by definition, spyware enabled by default. Telemetry, diagnostics, system information, location, inking and typing, and better yet it’s all tied to your Microsoft account (which at this point they practically force you to use and make one if you didn’t already have one) which allows them to profile you and serve you targeted ads within their services. Fast forward to 2021 and Windows 11 comes out, causing millions of computers to become e-waste in the near future because of Microsoft’s arbitrary system requirements (that’s a whole separate issue), Windows 11 now serves you those targeted ads within the operating system. Don’t forget, Windows is still paid software, it's not like this is a free product with ads, the MSRP for a Windows Home license is $139, and if you bought a computer from an OEM that cost is included in the price you paid, albeit at a discounted price most likely. You are purchasing this proprietary operating system to only have your information collected and sold so you can be shown personalized ads. Granted, a lot of these "features" can be turned off, but certainly not all of them and they shouldn’t be there in the first place. I’m no Apple fan either, but I have to give it to them, they don’t pull crap like this.</p>

							<p>Recall is Microsoft’s latest abomination. This "feature" essentially takes a screenshot of your computer every 5 seconds, the Copilot AI then scrapes the screenshots for text and data and creates a database of basically everything you have done on your computer. The idea then is you can go back in time and see a timeline of what you were doing.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/6.2024/maxres/recall.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/6.2024/recall.webp" alt="jobs.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>First of all, this is the most useless sounding thing I’ve ever heard of. Seriously, who finds something like this useful? It sounds like way more hassle than it’s worth to use. It uses an insane amount of disk space (50 GB minimum) and processing power, and not to mention the egregious privacy violations. If you were having a private text conversation, looking at compromising photos, banking, entering credit card details or passwords, literally anything it will be captured, there is no filter. Oh except DRM content like Netflix, because corporate interests is the only thing that matters. As of the writing of this post, Microsoft has said Recall will be disabled by default after the insane amount of backlash from, well everyone. The problem with this is Microsoft can change their minds any time they want. Currently Recall is exclusive to the new Copilot+ PC’s, but it won’t be forever and it will come to the x86 platform. Like most "features" Microsoft has added to Windows, a lot start out optional but then become mandatory. So even though Recall is opt in at launch, in a few years I expect it won’t even be opt out.</p>
							<p>In addition to all of that, this feature is horribly insecure. In fact it has <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xaitax/TotalRecall">already been hacked and busted wide open</a>. Microsoft says the data will be encrypted, but that only happens when you’re not using the computer. So it essentially makes no difference if you get a computer virus, only if someone physically steals your computer. With the amount of incredibly sensitive data in this feature better security measures need to be taken. And really, I can’t overstate that, your social security number could be stored in this thing if you used your computer to sign up for a bank account or something similar.</p>

					<h1>Backlash</h1>

							<p>I want to preface this section by saying there is a chance not all of these things were directly influenced by the announcement of Recall, but rather the direction of Microsoft and Windows in general.</p>

								<li><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/german-state-gov-ditching-windows-for-linux-30k-workers-migrating/">German state government migrating to Linux</a></li>

								<li>As of now it is ambiguous whether or not Recall complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law</li>
								<li>In response to the announcement of Recall an influx of people have said they are planning on switching to either Mac or Linux, how many actually do is to be seen</li>

					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>This is currently an absolute dumpster fire, if you search about Recall online the only thing you will see is 100’s of articles blasting the feature and talking about the backlash. I think Microsoft should just cancel this feature altogether and scrap it for good. If a feature like this actually gets implemented I think more than just local German governments will be switching, no government would want Microsoft to have that much control. Now a lot of users simply don’t care, they don’t mind if Microsoft handles their data like this as long as their computer works. I encourage those people to rethink their stance, but the fact is there will always be people who don’t care. If Microsoft is to ever change they need to be shown by the consumers, the Windows users, organizations, and governments, that they can’t get away with crap like this. You can do your part by either holding out on Windows 10 for the time being or better yet switching to anything other than Windows.</p>
