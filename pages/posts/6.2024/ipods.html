					<h1>1,000 Songs in Your Pocket</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Personally my iPod can hold a lot more than 1,000 songs, but that was the original slogan for the iPod. 1,000 songs might not seem like a lot today when we’re used to Spotify and streaming music, but back when the original iPod came out in 2001 people had been accustomed to carrying around a Walkman along with their cassette collection. So now suddenly having a device smaller than a Walkman that could hold 1,000 songs was pretty revolutionary for the time.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/6.2024/maxres/iflash.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/6.2024/iflash.webp" alt="iflash.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>My iPod can actually hold closer to 20,000 tracks. It is a 5th generation iPod (shown above in the post header) which I personally repaired and upgraded. It was broken sitting around in my house for a really long time, so long I don’t even remember how I got it, but I decided it would be a fun summer project last year so I bought some parts to fix it. That included a new battery, screen (I have no idea how but the original screen was completely destroyed, possibly from the battery swelling), and an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iflash.xyz/">iFlash adapter</a> (shown to the right) allowing me to replace the old mini mechanical hard drive with a much faster and more efficient SD card. So now my iPod has 128 GB of storage compared to the original 30 GB.</p>
							<p>The limiting factor for song storage isn’t actually that 128 GB SD card, but rather the iPod’s RAM. These old iPods only have so much RAM, and when you get to a certain number of songs on them they run out of RAM to properly shuffle your music library and from what I hear a lot of other weird issues start to crop up. This shouldn’t be an issue for me anytime soon as I only have roughly 1,700 songs on it after over a year of use.</p>

					<h1>Why Use an iPod Now?</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>I hate streaming services with a burning passion. Any kind, period. Music, movies, TV, even video games like Xbox Game Pass, I just hate streaming services. I understand why the idea of paying a relatively cheap monthly fee to access hundreds of hours worth of content is appealing to people, but what people don’t understand is the average person does not have the time every month to actually get their money’s worth out of that fee. I would rather buy a used copy of Star Trek: The Next Generation season 4 on eBay for $15 than pay $15 for Prime Video every month which now shows ads in a paid subscription. Some people do have the time, and good for them, but that’s only one issue I have. With streaming services you don’t own anything, at all. You could have been a Spotify subscriber for a decade, but you don’t actually own a single song. You are paying to basically rent that music. If you decide to finally cancel your Spotify subscription, all that money you’ve spent over the last decade just vanished into thin air, no more music. The other problem I have is streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music (or any of them really) always remove things randomly. I got sick of waking up just to see one of my songs grayed out in Spotify because it got removed for whatever reason. Not to mention artists barely make anything from music streaming services compared to in the past when people would buy a whole album. I won’t rant too long about it, and there are some websites I like, for example <a target="_blank" href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> which is half streaming service and half digital music purchasing website which actually supports the artists.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/6.2024/maxres/jobs.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/6.2024/jobs.webp" alt="jobs.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Now this is just one tiny reason, and not even my main one, because of course if you wanted you could load your digital (owned, not streamed) music library onto a smartphone and not use an iPod at all. The main reason I like using an iPod is because it changes how I listen to music. Too often do I find myself on a phone (streaming service or not), cherry picking specific songs, skipping around within them, queuing things up, etc. Nowadays this is the norm, and none of these things are inherently bad, but everything in moderation. See, in the past people used to put on a record, or a CD, and listen to a whole album start to finish (with some exceptions like mixtapes). In fact some albums really should be listened to like this, for example Dark Side of the Moon. The songs flow together and tell a story. The problem with modern streaming services is they have almost killed this idea, most modern artists just want to make a hit song now, and not many people listen to albums start to finish and thus a lot of artists (mostly the pop ones) don’t create interesting flowing music anymore. In my opinion, streaming services have really dumbed down modern music. The convenience has come at a cost and the way we listen to modern music hurts our attention span for it, skipping through songs and within them, only adding really upbeat catchy stuff to our playlists, etc. No one has the patience to listen through full albums as much now, or god forbid a song has a slow intro.</p>
							<p>My rule for myself when I use my iPod is I will only put full albums on it, I don’t cherry pick songs. And I’ve actually discovered a lot of music I really like that I wouldn’t have found otherwise. Songs on albums in between the hits that I wouldn’t have ever listened to on Spotify. My point is the iPod changes how I listen to music for the better, I listen to more albums start to finish, and I’ve discovered more music with the iPod compared to Spotify Discover Weekly. That’s just for me, I’m sure not everyone is the same, but I really do think the iPod is a better listening experience than any streaming service I’ve used. And of course I use the shuffle feature, I don’t only listen to entire albums start to finish.</p>
							<p>And my last reason, it’s just fun. It’s cool having an iPod for music, a dedicated offline device separate from everything else. It was a fun project restoring it and I like using it. People comment on it just like people might compliment your new shoes too.</p>

					<h1>Should You Get an iPod?</h1>

							<p>The answer isn’t so black and white. iPod’s can be annoying to get up and running, after all they are old. Most of them have failing batteries and/or old dying hard drives. Personally I have the technical knowledge to remedy these issues myself, but the majority of people don’t. And some iPods are also really hard to open and fix/upgrade, some of which are so difficult I wouldn’t even attempt it. If you are going to buy an iPod I would recommend the same 5th gen I have, they are easy to open, and very easy to swap out most of the parts. The headphone jack, hold switch, hard drive, screen, click wheel, and shell can all be easily replaced. This generation of iPod also has a Wolfson DAC (digital to analog converter) inside, which a lot of audiophiles say sound much better than the later iPods which all use Apple’s own DACs. Personally I’m not so sure, I’m no audiophile, but if they say so then why not.</p>
							<p>In addition you can find a lot of already upgraded/fixed iPods on eBay! So if you have the extra money and lack the repair skills yourself you could go for one of those. From what I can tell iPods are becoming more popular right now so you can probably expect prices to be going up.</p>
							<p>If you find what I talked about interesting, and also want to ditch streaming services, then go for it, the iPod even in 2024 is a great portable music player. Just be careful which model you buy, as I said some are very difficult to fix.</p>
