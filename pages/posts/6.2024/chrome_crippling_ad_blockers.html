					<h1>What Is Extension Manifest V3?</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Most people know what browser extensions are, they are small programs you can install into your web browser that add extended functionality. For example "Honey", an extension which checks for coupon codes before you buy something online. However, some of the most notorious extensions are ad blockers, these extensions will hide advertisements you would normally see on the web. The vast majority of these advertisements are served by Google. So its no wonder they aren’t happy that an ever growing amount of people are using ad blockers to circumvent Google’s primary source of profit.</p>
							<p>These browser extensions are programmed on top of a specific platform, in the case of Google Chrome it is called the "Extension Manifest". For a long while now developers have been using Manifest version two, however, Google has now released version three and is actively deprecating version two. This is a problem because in every aspect version three is a downgrade from version two severally limiting the capabilities of extensions for the Chromium platform. One of the things removed in version three is the “webRequest API” which is what ad blockers rely on to actually block ads. Google themselves say on <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3">their website</a> this feature "came at a performance and privacy cost". I find this amusing as Google Chrome is notorious for being bloated and resource heavy compared to other browsers, and its Google for god’s sake. You think they care at all about privacy?</p>
							<p>It is obvious the real reason for these changes is to cripple ad blockers so people can no longer block ads and thus Google can make more money.</p>

					<h1>Implications</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>This will have big implications for a lot of users. Google Chrome is by far the dominant web browser, so for the majority of users this will make ad blockers near unusable. In fact, most other browsers are based off of Google Chrome: Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera, just to name a few. All of these browsers will no longer have fully functional ad blockers in the near future.</p>
							<p>So what can you do? Well one of the best options at this point is to switch to Firefox. Firefox is not deprecating Manifest version two like Google is and thus all ad blockers will continue to work indefinitely. Firefox also collects much less user data and is much more transparent about what they do collect. The reason Firefox is not affected by this is because Firefox is truly separate from Google Chrome and the Chromium project, Firefox has its own code base and is a truly separate browser.</p>
							<p>I do think a lot of users will start switching to Firefox. The thing is: once an ad block user, always an ad block user. Once you use an ad blocker and see how much more nice the internet becomes you never want to go back to an unfiltered internet. I think this change alone will drive most ad block users away from Chrome to use Firefox instead. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221">The FBI even recommends</a> you to use an ad blocker on the internet. Because its not just as simple as looking at an ad, a lot of the ads online are chock full of malicious trackers or even trying to get you to download a virus. For example some ads pose as fake download links.</p>

					<h1>My Recommendation</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Even if you have never used an ad blocker before now is a great time to start. In fact usage of ad blockers has shot up recently. Because in Google’s war on ad blockers, they have only managed to raise public awareness of them in result almost encouraging people to try them. I recommend switching to Firefox (it is very easy and you can carry over all of your bookmarks and data) and using a extension called <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>. It is by far one of the most advanced ad blockers available and has over 7.5 million users, all for free.</p>
