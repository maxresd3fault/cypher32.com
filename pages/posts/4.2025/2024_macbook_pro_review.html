					<h1>Apples to Apples</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Before Apple Silicon I would have never even considered buying a Mac. You could find the same Intel chips, in more reliable hardware for much less money and that was the end of it. At that time (pre 2020) really the only thing Apple brought to the table was a dubious butterfly keyboard and macOS. Granted, for certain professionals like musicians it might have still been worth it to be able to use software like Logic Pro, but for the average person and web developer like me it was all a mute point.</p>
							<p>That all changed with Apple Silicon, it is so good that I feel Macs are actually now worth the infamous "Apple tax". Apple Silicon isn't just a better CPU than the previous Intel chips, but it is a whole different CPU architecture which changes everything. Apple Silicon is based on the ARM CPU architecture, which by all means is not new. ARM has been used in cell phones since the very first iPhone, and Apple has been developing their own ARM chips for the iPhone for a long time now. Why switch from x86 Intel? ARM is an architecture much better suited to mobile computers, including laptops, it emphasizes efficiency, draws less power, runs cooler, but can still be extremely fast with its combination of efficiency and performance cores. Apple can continue to make their ridiculously thin laptops with inadequate cooling which is now no longer a problem with Apple Silicon, opposed to the previous Intel machines which were basically melting and sounded like jet engines.</p>
							<p>However in my opinion the biggest thing Apple Silicon brings to the table is consistent performance. By that I mean the laptop will have the exact same performance potential regardless of if it is plugged in or not. This is a huge deal, especially for users who buy a laptop to do actual work like video editing or photo editing. Apple Silicon chips draw so little power even under full load that the battery can allow the chip to run at full speed even when the charger is disconnected, this is something traditionally not possible on x86 laptops. For example, on my <a href="/pages/posts/12.2024/framework_16_review.html">previously reviewed Framework 16</a>, the AMD Ryzen 7840HS needs to draw more power than the battery can provide to hit its full potential. In fact, that chip draws so much power, that even when the 180W power adapter is connected it still will need to draw additional power from the battery. The Apple Silicon MacBooks will preform the same weather or not they are plugged in. You'd be hard pressed to find that anywhere else on the market right now. And as for the Snapdragon Windows on ARM laptops, they suck. More importantly, the software support sucks. Maybe they will be better in a few years but those machines cannot compete on the level of the Apple ARM devices currently.</p>

					<h1>The Good</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>In my introduction I already mentioned the biggest benefit of these devices, so if you skipped that then go back and read it. Not only can these machines perform the same on the battery as plugged in, but they do it with shockingly good battery life. Apple has stuffed these computers with huge batteries, that combined with the chip hardly drawing anything means not even all day battery life, but all week battery life. Seriously, I can get by with charging this computer once a week when I'm not doing anything too intense on it.</p>
							<p>The chips also run cool, far cooler than any of the Intel Macs of the past. I have been using this computer for about a month now and the fans have not turned on a single time. I'd like to point out as well I have been using this computer for photo editing and light video editing, and still the fans haven't turned on once. If you plan on running sustained loads on the computer, like exporting huge video projects or running local AI models consistently, then probably prepare yourself for some fan noise. But compared to my Framework 16, this thing doesn't make a sound. And it's running cool too, I have not taken exact measurements but the chassis hardly ever even feels warm when doing these tasks.</p>
							<p>The display is amazing, it's a 3024x1964 mini LED display. It gets very bright, and has amazing color. It's perfect for editing my photography with its rich and accurate colors. It is also what Apple calls "ProMotion" which is just a fancy buzzword for variable refresh rate. This means when nothing is moving on the screen the computer will lower the refresh rate to conserve battery, and when things start moving again the display can go all the way up to a smooth 120Hz. The screen has very minor "<a target="_blank" href="https://techcomparison.net/what-is-blooming-understanding-this-common-tv-display-issue/">blooming</a>" which is expected for mini LED displays, but supposedly Apple has improved this over previous models of the MacBook Pro. Regardless, I hardly notice it.</p>
							<p>The hardware itself. Apple has always made really good feeling hardware out of premium materials. But it is much better now because I no longer consider it to be form over function like the Intel days. The keyboard is good, not the best I've used but above average for laptops, and the speakers blow my mind. Nobody makes better laptop speakers than Apple. The force touch glass trackpad is also still best in class for the entire laptop market. But my favorite part is the ports, thank god Apple finally listed to its "Pro" customer base. The 2024 MacBook Pro has three thunderbolt ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack capable of driving high impedance headphones, a now HDMI 2.1 port, and thank the heavens a full sized SD card slot. This means for me as a photographer I no longer have to carry around a bunch of cables and dongles for my camera. Finally, we also still have the MagSafe charging connecter, which I personally love. I really hope Apple won't go nuclear on the ports again, and will leave all these connectors at least for future Pro models of their computers. (The Mac Studio even has full sized USB A ports my god!)</p>

					<h1>The Bad</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>It's still Apple at the end of the day. When you buy this computer you are buying a hardly repairable device, which is obviously at complete odds with something like the Framework 16. It's able to be lighter and more solid feeling than the Framework, which is one of the reasons I bought it, but if something breaks you are at the mercy of Apple. Apple has surprisingly put socketed SSD's into both the Mac Mini and Mac Studio, but alas this is absent from all of their laptops. I really wish that wasn't the case. No upgrades, and no repairs, unless you are a professional at soldering.</p>
							<p>The base model only has 512GB of storage. For a computer over $1,000 I feel like 1TB really should be the bare minimum. Thankfully Apple recently upgraded the minimum RAM for all their computers from 8GB to 16GB. I would not have bought this computer if I had to pay extra for 16GB of ram in 2025. I hope they do the same with the storage soon too, a larger SSD would also mean a longer lifespan for your non-replaceable storage. Personally most of my work is on external storage and I can get by with just 512GB, but the prices Apple charges for storage upgrades is insanity. So, for people who do need more internal storage, this could be a deal breaker.</p>
							<p>The only thing about the hardware that really annoys me is the speaker grills. Again they sound great, but the speaker grills themselves are the perfectly wrong size to trap a bunch of dust which is then difficult to get out. A minor annoyance, but I do wonder if overtime this could affect the sound quality.</p>

					<h1>macOS</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/4.2025/macOS.webp" alt="macOS.webp" width="200" height="125"/>I feel this needs its own section, because it is both good and bad. Operating systems will largely be based on a personal preference, and if you didn't like macOS at all you probably wouldn't buy a Mac. I think it's fine. I think it's far more stable, faster, efficient, and private than Windows is, but it still has its problems. It gives you a lot of the Unix experience that Linux can, but much more locked down and restricted. I prefer Linux in the end, but I appreciate macOS and would use it any day over Windows. That's one of the main reasons I bought this thing, to finally get away from Windows and run certain proprietary software on macOS that doesn't work on Linux.</p>
							<p>Some things about macOS are amazing, the Automator program which lets you add custom quick actions to Finder has sped up my photography workflow so much. And I could never go back to doing my photography work on Windows again. However there are also a lot of just weird things about macOS. You can't shift click selections of items in the icon view in Finder. Just why? You can do it in list view, but not icon view. Has no one at Apple noticed this since OS X came out over 20 years ago? If you want to use an external mouse it can't have a different scroll direction than the trackpad unless you install a 3rd party program. Again, why? Even ChromeOS lets you do this out of the box. These little annoyances add up and make the system more frustrating to use, if Apple fixed these small things it would be a much better overall experience.</p>
							<p>I do like the macOS desktop environment, I think it looks nice and I think its functional. Window management can still be clunky at times but overall I think it's still better than Windows' desktop environment which hasn't changed or innovated on anything since Windows 95.</p>
							<p>I very much dislike Apple Intelligence. It is quite a small AI model and pretty limited, plus I feel I do not need any of its features. Things like notification summaries just don't interest me. And a lot of its other features like writing assistance can be done better by other AI models like Copilot and ChatGPT for free. What infuriates me about Apple Intelligence is you cannot remove it from macOS 15 Sequoia. This is a major blunder, similar in vein the the Microsoft Recall blunder. On my MacBook, Apple Intelligence takes up a staggering 10GB and cannot be removed, that is unacceptable especially with how much Apple charges for storage. Besides, hardcore AI enthusiasts are probably going to run their own models locally anyway, these Macs are more than powerful enough for it. So why force them to have both Apple Intelligence in addition to whatever else they choose to use? I am glad it can be disabled, but there is no reason why it should be unremovable. Do better.</p>
							<p>Overall, I have found macOS to be stable, fast, and relatively private. It works with a lot of the same Linux tools I use via the <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">Brew package manager</a> and I feel at home using it. Switching between macOS and Linux on a daily basis feels smooth. I'd also like to add, Linux is slowly making progress on Apple Silicon and becoming better and better by the day via the <a target="_blank" href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux project</a>.</p>

					<h1>The Verdict</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>It really just comes down to what you want and need. I bought this computer for two main reasons:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The portability, size, weight, battery life, and performance on battery life</li>
								<li>To finally cut all ties with Windows and use a Unix like OS for all my work</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you understand what you are buying and accept you won't be able to fix it yourself then go for it. The hardware feels great to use, the software support is great and stable, and I couldn't be happier about finally cutting out my last ties to Windows. If you are a power user who really needs the full power of your computer on the go this is a great option utilizing the efficiency of ARM. If you simply want longer battery life this is still a very compelling option. Not everyone needs the MacBook Pro, I got it because I do video and photo editing and I wanted a computer with active cooling that won't thermal throttle. But most people will probably have more than enough power at their finger tips with just the M4 MacBook Air. I really like the direction Apple is going today, and maybe one day we will see socketed storage in their laptops again just like we did in the Mac Mini and Mac Studio.</p>
							<p>Microsoft knows what Apple is doing is working, that's why they are scrambling to make Windows on ARM laptops. I don't have one, but I'd recommend seeking out <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/zFMTJm3vmh0?si=W511sWXXCcFt1W1c">other reviews</a>, they simply aren't there yet. The benefit of Apple controlling both the hardware and software is that they can have a much smoother transition to an entirely new CPU architecture unlike Microsoft. Apple has the balls to make big changes like this, where Microsoft just plays catch up, and I respect that even if there are things about Apple I don't like.</p>
