					<h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>

						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>The original Half-Life is now 25 years old, now that's crazy! One thing is for sure, they don't make them like they used to. Well and some don't make them at all anymore *cough cough* (Valve). But what a game, and Valve is pulling out all the stops to throw quite the birthday party.</p>
							<p>Valve in the company sense has never really been known for being super nostalgic, but it looks like they've made an exception this time (in fact there is even a "Nostalgia" section in the <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/70/view/6941797379568863069">change log</a>). This update is massive, and not only fixes bugs and brings new content, but reworks entire parts of the GoldSrc engine!</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/11.2023/maxres/pool_party.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/11.2023/pool_party.webp" alt="pool_party.webp" width="200" height="125"/></a>This is very good news for mappers and modders of Half-Life as the engine is a lot more flexible now, and less buggy on modern operating systems, which should allow more creativity. And Valve proved this by including their own new maps taking advantage of these new limits:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>contamination</li>
								<li>pool_party</li>
								<li>disposal</li>
								<li>rocket_frenzy</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The engine improvements include sound limits raised, entity limits raised, geometry limits raised (about doubled), and even added the func_vehicle entity from Counter-Strike! And boy does it show, this is a screenshot of pool_party above to the right. Do remember, this game is from 1998. Pretty impressive if I say so.</p>

					<h1>Even More Goodies</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>But somehow Valve decided everything mentioned above wasn't enough. They also added all of Half-Life Uplink to the base game, this was previously only playable via a mod or if you had an original disk. Half-Life Uplink is a short promotional version of Half-Life released why back when to hype the game up. Hence its not very long but including it in the base game makes it a lot more accessible.</p>
							<p>Valve also balanced the multiplayer, brought back the old main menu UI, the old Valve intro video, changed the default models to the non HD ones (the better ones), they added an Ivan the Space Biker player model (a early concept of Gordon Freeman), added other old expansion maps, new sprays, and improved the integration with Steam.</p>
							<p>It's honestly kind of overwhelming just how much stuff this update brings and changes, maybe too overwhelming...</p>

					<h1>Issues</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p><img class="image-right" src="/images/posts/11.2023/mainmenu_thumb.gif" alt="mainmenu_thumb.gif" width="200" height="125"/>Unfortunately there are some issues with this huge update. First and foremost: due to the nature of upgrading the GoldSrc engine, this will inevitably break a lot of mods. And it has! But not only mods, but Valve's own games. For example Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, and more GoldSrc games are currently broken. Some kind of work, some crash on launch, others have just weird issues. It looks like Valve overlooked everything except Half-Life when pushing this update.</p>
							<p>Now you may be wondering why a Half-Life update would affect these games. Well all of the other "games" using GoldSrc on steam are technically just mods, they run on top of Half-Life as the core game.</p>
							<p>However there is a fix, you can roll back your Half-Life to the pre 25th anniversary version to get compatibility back, but hopefully this is temporary as it is quite annoying. I am sure Valve will update their other games. As for modders that is unclear, I am sure some will but old mods that aren't maintained might stay broken. All I can say is I hope Valve keeps letting users roll back their game to keep compatibility.</p>
							<p>It's a little bittersweet but it's kind of expected with an update like this. My other issue is a little more personal. When it comes to game preservation I really enjoy experiencing the original version of said game, and I always play it if I can. I don't typically like playing remasters or remakes unless there is a really good reason too. And there are plenty of good reasons to play this new Half-Life update, but it's not a remaster, nor a remake. You can play Black Mesa if you want that (which is really good). So that's my issue, giving such an old game such a massive update changes it. For example, the reimplementation of the old main menu is a recreation of it, not the original. It looks similar, but it's not the same (pictured to the right). The server browser is not the original server browser, same with the options menu. So it feels a little weird, and not authentic. It's a minor issue but I feel like it does matter to an extent.</p>

					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Even before the 25th anniversary update Valve was still occasionally updating Half-Life with fixes and patches, so it's nothing new. The scale of this is just huge in comparison. For the purists out there it's definitely possible to get ahold of an original CD or find the original build of the game online somewhere.</p>
							<p>Overall this update is great! And has totally got people interested in the game again, even better that Valve made the game free for the weekend (to keep forever) so new players can check it out too. I would definitely recommend playing it and I am sure Valve will iron out the issues.</p>
