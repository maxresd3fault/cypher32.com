							<p>Well it has been almost a whole year and no new content added to my website. I got busy and got burnt out from putting so much time into the site so fast.</p>
							<p>However I am wanting to continue updating the site and adding new content and photos! It will take a while for me to upload all the rest of my photos to the site, so stay tuned. And new posts will be coming.</p>

					<h1>Moving Forward</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>I plan on adding new posts and photos for now. I don't have too much else planned but as things come up I will add them. There's no doubt this website is fairly basic in design, but I like that. It allows me to do what I want (text posts and photos) and doesn't get in the way. I feel like it doesn't need to be much more complicated than it already is and that it's a good framework.</p>
