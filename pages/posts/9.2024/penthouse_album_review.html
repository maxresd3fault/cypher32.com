A while back I got one of Luna's later albums, Rendezvous (2004), from a Goodwill and I loved it. Despite Luna being classified as a rock band, I would consider them to be more of a "soft" rock band. Their sound is defined by melodic electric guitar and lead singer Dean Wareham's (shown to the right) mellow voice. I find their music to be very relaxing and calming. However, after listening to Rendezvous I haven't gotten around to listening to the rest of their work. So, I picked a random album from their discography, and I'm going to share my thoughts about it now.</p>
							<p>Penthouse is full of dreamy sounding guitar, ambiguous lyrics that offer multiple interpretations, all while being never too loud and never too quiet. It strikes a perfect balance between catchiness, and more non-traditional sound. Tracks like Sideshow by the Seashore highlight this, with a very catchy chorus but accompanied by an interesting non-traditional melody that makes use of a lot of wah effect; the guitar in the chorus of this song almost sounds like it's crying out to the listener. Songs like Moon Palace also make use of this wah effect, but I do not feel it is overused. I think it only adds to the uniqueness of Luna and the distinct sound of their playing.</p>
							<p>Despite the overall feel of Luna's music being relaxing, tracks like Double Feature combine this feeling while also laying down a heavier beat, but not at the cost of sacrificing the softer tone of the music. Songs like 23 Minutes in Brussels break this trend a little bit, slowly building up to a more loud climax. This song in particular sounds somewhat similar to the band Spiritualized, without as many thrills. However, that simpler sound is not a bad thing, Luna seems to know what sound they have perfected and don't break that mold all too much with this album.</p>
							<p>As for lyrics, I think Luna tends to go the more ambiguous unimposing route. I find Kalamazoo to be the most interesting lyrically. With parts like, "Well the week is too short, But the days is so long, Living with sick people, Makes me feel so strong". These lyrics can be interpreted in many different ways, allowing the listener to apply the music to themselves and their own feelings.</p>
							<p>Despite this album being released a whole nine years before the first Luna album I listened to, it still retains the band's iconic sound. Tracks like Lost in Space highlight how Luna is able to accomplish the sound of soft rock. My personal favorite track is Rhythm King, with its catchy guitar, playful lyrics, and slow build up. I recommend this album if you like interesting guitar and abstract lyrics, it can fit many different moods and I think enjoyers of many different genres could all appreciate this type of music.</p>
