							<p>I love the entire Half-Life series. And with Half-Life 2 turning 20 this November I decided to replay all of the games. The franchise started out as a statement by Valve to show that video games can be fun but also have stories just as interesting as other mediums like movies and books. It then evolved to be a statement for other things on a more technical level. For example to show off real time dynamic physics and realistic facial animations. But even while moving on to innovate in other areas, the writing only got better.</p>
							<p>Half-Life 2 showcases one of the worst situations a future humanity could imaginably be in. This is slowly revealed to the player through environmental story telling, audio and visual cues, and subtle themes. Its not shoved into the player's face, but rather the player slowly comes to the horrifying realization that things are not looking good.</p>
							<p>But before we can talk about what humanity's situation is in Half-Life 2, we must first gloss over how we got here with the events of the original Half-Life.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/9.2024/maxres/test-chamber.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/9.2024/test-chamber.webp" alt="test-chamber.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>In Half-Life 1 you play as Gordon Freeman, the same protagonist for most of the other games. Gordon is an MIT graduate working at the anonymous materials department in Black Mesa, a secretive government research facility in New Mexico. The game starts out as a normal day of work, with Gordon operating a test on a crystal, its whereabouts unknown at this point. Immediately after the crystal enters the "anti-mass spectrometer" (shown to the right) to analyze it, all hell breaks loose. Green lightning starts flashing and portals start opening and teleporting alien creatures into all corners of the facility. The rest of the first game involves Gordon fighting his way through the facility and eventually traveling to the other world that the aliens are coming from. This other world is called Xen, and it is where the crystal used in the experiment at the start of the game is native to. However outside of these crystals, none of the life and aliens living in Xen are native to it. Xen is a "border world" that connects multiple different universes with different species of aliens from all corners of these universes finding their way to it. Gordon's fight through Xen culminates in him killing the Nihilanth, a creature belonging to a near extinct species that has enslaved many of the other species in Xen to do its bidding. The game ends with Gordon then being put into stasis by the ever so mysterious "G-Man". The story is much more complicated than all of this and I am glossing over many details, but this is enough background to just talk about what is going on in Half-Life 2.</p>

The Earth has been conquered by an interdimensional super race known as the Combine. They are somewhat similar to the Borg from Star Trek, in the idea that they assimilate other races and species into their own. The Combine took over Earth in a mere seven hours after the events of Half-Life 1 when portals to Xen opened, alerting the Combine of the Earth's existence. However, unlike other worlds the Combine has conquered, sentience is allowed on Earth. Some people are allowed to live in their natural unmodified human state.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/9.2024/maxres/citadel.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/9.2024/citadel.webp" alt="citadel.webp" width="125" height="192"/></a>The game takes place in "City 17", one of the largest remaining urban centers. The name obviously alluding to the fact that there are not many left. A man named Wallace Breen (who was Gordon Freeman's former administrator at Black Mesa, shown to the left) acts as humanity's representative to the combine. He lives in the top of the massive citadel (shown to the right) built in the center of the city. The citadel's purpose is to house Combine troops, augment humans, and allow for easier watch and control over the city. The reason humanity is still allowed to exist at all is because Dr. Breen made a deal with the Combine. In the Half-Life universe the humans have one edge over the Combine, humanity has cracked the code to teleportation but the Combine has not. The Combine are forced to use ordinary local forms of transportation such as trains and helicopters, and they desperately want this technology. So they are keeping humanity around to let them finish developing it for them then it is implied humanity would be wiped out afterwards. Dr. Breen made this deal, and humanity is allowed to remain for now, but at the cost of their freedom. The population is heavily controlled and conditioned and that is what I wanted to talk about in this post.</p>
							<p>The "society" (if it can even be called that) that exists in Half-Life 2 is fascinating. Through the forms of story telling mentioned at the start of this post we learn that:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Citizens are relocated every couple of years at minimum. This is probably to stop them from forming any real friends and/or relationships that could lead to comradery.</li>
								<li>Citizens are drugged through their food and water rations to keep them complacent.</li>
								<li>Dr. Breen's propaganda broadcasts are played 24/7 throughout the city.</li>
								<li>There is a "suppression field" which halts humanity's ability to reproduce. So the people currently living on Earth will be the last unless the suppression field eventually gets turned off.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/9.2024/maxres/cp.jpg"><img class="image-right-a" src="/images/posts/9.2024/cp.webp" alt="cp.webp" width="125" height="192"/></a>There is even more, for example all the citizens are forced to wear identical blue clothes, almost like a prison jumpsuit. Where it gets really interesting is how the Combine enforce their rules. There is a unit in City 17 called "Civil Protection" (shown to the right) which consists of unmodified humans who voluntarily choose to side with the combine and oppress their fellow humans in exchange for more rations and freedoms. The Combine soldiers in the higher ranks are fully augmented humans lacking self awareness and free will. Once someone joins Civil Protection they are heavily incentivized to slowly ascend the ranks and trade more of their humanity for more freedom and rations. However there are also many humans who are taken and augmented involuntarily into Combine soldiers. The Combine's goal is to simply expand and become more powerful, not just to destroy. They won't wipe out a species but simply take it over instead.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/9.2024/maxres/coast.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/posts/9.2024/coast.webp" alt="coast.webp" width="200" height="125"></a>Over the course of the game as we leave the city, even more is learned about this future Earth. For example, the Combine are draining the oceans and resources of the planet (example shown to the left) to transport to other planets under their control which are in need of them. The other alien creatures from the first game still run rampant outside of the city borders, some of them even being weaponized by the Combine such as the famous headcrabs. Most of the pre-war human made structures at this point are falling apart, with the exception of some infrastructure such as railways which the Combine still use to their own advantage.</p>
							<p>With all of this an interesting moral dilemma is reached. Was Dr. Breen right to bargain with the Combine? Of course if he didn't the human race would have just been assimilated and wiped out as we know it, without the Combine ever having realized the possibly of acquiring teleportation technology. The conditions that people live in under Combine rule are abhorrent, but they are still living. This one fact alone is what gives the possibility for a rebellion to form and the events of Half-Life 2 and its episodes to unfold. The population hates Dr. Breen, but again, if it weren't for him none of them would still be "alive". It is unclear if Dr. Breen believes the Combine is humanity's future, or if he is simply sucking up to them to keep his own species alive. I think that is a conclusion the player is supposed to reach on their own.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, Half-Life 2 has one of the best stories of any shooter game I've played. This game seriously immerses the player in its world through its storytelling and very surreal envisioning of this future. The Combine seem like an almost impossibly large force to take on, again they took over the planet in only seven hours, and that is what makes the game so fun and suspenseful. This post really didn't do the game justice and I glossed over a lot. The best way to experience this story is to play the games. Because the games really do make you <em>experience</em> the story. By throwing you right into these worlds and not holding your hand, letting the player come to these realizations themselves.</p>
