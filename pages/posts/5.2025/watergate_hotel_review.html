							<p>The Watergate is a famous building complex in Washington DC, constructed between 1963 and 1971 at a cost of $78 million. It consists of residential apartments, offices, and a hotel. Its name is most widely associated with the Watergate political scandal. The scandal began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters, located in the Watergate complex, and involved members of President Richard Nixon's administration attempting to cover it up. The ensuing investigation uncovered widespread abuse of power, ultimately leading to Nixonâ€™s resignation in 1974.</p>
							<p>Today, the hotel is quite a popular tourist destination considering its turbulent history. When I was in DC recently I got the chance to stay there for two nights. It is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in, it is a 5 star luxury hotel after all.</p>
							<p>The hotel portion of the complex houses two bars (one on the roof), a restaurant, convention center floor, a gorgeous lobby, and free coffee in the morning. I booked through <a href="https://www.trivago.deals/" target="_blank">trivago DEALS</a> which saved a few $100 compared to the official website. Once you arrive to the hotel you will find most things are quite expensive, all the snacks and drinks in the room are very overpriced, and even the water bottles in the room are $9. The hotel's bars and restaurant are also quite pricy, the main restaurant was selling breakfast for almost $40. Besides the high prices though, the experience was very good. All the public spaces were clean and pretty, and the room was nice as well.</p>

A room similar to the one I stayed in is shown to the right. Aside from the hotel itself, the Watergate Complex also has a few shops, a USPS store, and a nice little restaurant called the <a href="https://www.tazzadc.com/" target="_blank">Tazza Cafe</a> which is not too expensive. I went there for breakfast one morning and the food was quite good. Many people inside all seemed to know each other, presumably they all live in the apartment complex and are regulars at the restaurant.</p>
							<p>The hotel also offers a brief tour of the so-called "Scandal Suite" (which can also be booked for a huge cost) where one of the hotel staff will show you some historical artifacts related to the scandal. Unfortunately I did not have time to do this, and it costs $70. Speaking of the staff, all of them were exceedingly nice and helpful. Lastly, I think the hotel's location is also perfect, it is right next to the Potomac river with great views, just a few minutes walk from the Kennedy Center, and Georgetown is also in walking distance.</p>
							<p>In the end the hotel was fun to stay at, but I would probably not stay there again. It's a good experience to have once, but prices are very high for everything. I'd recommend it if you're going to DC with some friends and want a fun experience, but probably avoid spending any money in the hotel once you're there.</p>
