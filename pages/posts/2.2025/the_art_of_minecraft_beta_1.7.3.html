							<p>If you have ever played video games, there is a high likelihood you have played Minecraft at some point. After all, it is the most sold video game in history as of now. Minecraft is an interesting case of a video game because it is unlike most others. It is a "sandbox" game, where there is no linear path to follow or set of goals you have to complete. Similar sandbox games comprise the likes of Garry's Mod, Terraria, and Rising World. But when most people think of sandbox games they default to Minecraft. Why is that? Minecraft has accessibility, simplicity, and a legacy. However, one of the points of this article is that its simplicity is quickly fading, and along with it its identity.</p>
							<p>Minecraft is a game that is over 14 years old now. That is a <em>very</em> long time in the gaming space. Most games become irrelevant just a year or two after their release when new ones come in to grab peopleâ€™s time and attention. One reason Minecraft has been able to stay such a huge figure in the gaming landscape despite its age is because Mojang continuously updates the game. This gives people a reason to keep playing and experiment with new features and game mechanics. That's great! But like I said, it has been 14 long years, that's 14 years worth of updates. In my opinion, the modern game is almost unrecognizable from what the earlier game envisioned by Notch and his buddies was.</p>
							<p>If you replace a part of a ship, it remains the same ship. But if you keep replacing the parts until every part is replaced, is it still the same ship? That is the "Ship of Theseus" paradox, and I think Minecraft can start to be thought of in this way. In the modern game the textures, the sounds, the core game loop, the lighting engine, the world generation, and much more have all been changed. At what point is Minecraft gone and we are left with a new game? I should clarify, I am not saying the modern game is "bad", I just prefer the older versions of the game that were made under Notch's Mojang and not Microsoft's. I see the appeal of the modern game and why people enjoy it. Let me explain why I like the older versions.</p>
							<p>First and foremost, the philosophy of the game was different back then. I would say before the 1.9 update (which was the first major update under Microsoft) the philosophy behind Minecraft updates was "what can we add that is cool?", whereas the philosophy today is more along the lines of "what can we add that will keep attention on Minecraft and keep it relevant?". An example of this would be the Creeper, the iconic mob. In case you didn't know, the Creeper was an accident. Originally Notch was trying to code a pig but the model got messed up and the pig was walking around vertically. He liked the shape and turned it into the Creeper. I highly doubt under the current corporate pressure of Microsoft anything like this would ever happen again.</p>
							<p>The game was also just simpler back then, there was less stuff. This is the part that really just depends person to person, but I really prefer the simpler game with less stuff. By less stuff I mean less blocks and items. The main reason I prefer this is because it makes it easier to build, there are less blocks to choose from when doing a build and that makes it easier to plan it and actually get started. Today, there are so many different blocks that you must know what works together and what doesn't to have a build that looks good in terms of color and texture. That was never a problem in the older simpler versions. In the newer versions your inventory also fills up much quicker with tons of junk whereas in older versions of the game everything you collected felt more important. I believe limitations encourage creativity within the bounds of those limitations, and that is evident in older Minecraft where the style people would build in is completely different from the game now. I'd also argue the game today is less of a sandbox than it used to be. Because the game now has goals, and an ending. The modern game has boss fights, and a credits sequence! This adds a sense of finality to your world and some people might stop playing after they beat the Ender Dragon.</p>

This was the last version of the game to lack a hunger bar, experience points, and anything related to The End. This version has exploded in popularity in recent years as Minecraft players yearn for the original traditional experience. Despite Beta being, well, a Beta, I find it incredibly polished in its gameplay experience. The only goal in 1.7.3 is to build, and this version of the game encourages that instead of other distractions. I love building in Beta with the limited block selection, the aesthetics of the old lighting engine, and the off the rails terrain generation. A screenshot from the world I play with my friends is shown to the right, the same world is also shown in the header of this post.</p>
							<p><a target="_blank" href="/images/posts/2.2025/maxres/glacier.jpg"><img class="image-left-a" src="/images/posts/2.2025/glacier.webp" alt="glacier.webp" width="200" height="125"/></a>To the left is the famous "Glacier" seed which works in Beta 1.7.3. This naturally generating world features stunning terrain and mountains, which somewhat resemble an actual glacier. In modern Minecraft you just do not see terrain generation like this anymore. Beta features gorgeous floating islands, and impressive mountains, making every seed feel truly unique and special. Yes, modern Minecraft now has the caves and cliffs update. But honestly, it's way too overdone. The caves and cliffs in modern Minecraft are pretty, but are far too inconvenient to be fun to play with. They are simply too big, making it really annoying to mine in the caves or build on/around the mountains. Beta's terrain really is the best out of any version of the game in my opinion. No it's not realistic, but this is a video game, its pretty and fun.</p>
							<p>Everyone is entitled to like what they like. When it comes to Minecraft versions I feel like there's three types of people:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The people who swear by older "purer" versions</li>
								<li>The people who play the modern game and don't understand why they'd play an older version with less stuff</li>
								<li>The people who don't care</li>
							</ul>
							<p>I might be one of the people who swears by the "purer" version, but I do not fault anyone for enjoying the modern game. Like I said, I understand its appeal, it's just not for me. I would highly encourage anyone who hasn't played Beta before to try it. It makes for a much more slow paced and meaningful experience I think. Between the aesthetics and simplicity, this version of the game from 2011 is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
