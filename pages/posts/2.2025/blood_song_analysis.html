					<h1>Intro</h1>

						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>Today we are going to look at another song by the band Abandoned Pools. I <a href="/pages/posts/8.2024/sunny_day_song_analysis.html">previously</a> gave my interpretation of the lyrics from another track ("Sunny Day") on the same album, "Humanistic". I think this just goes to show how potent Tommy Walter's writing is; as to warrant me writing two articles about his songs.</p>

					<h1>Analysis</h1>
					<div class="cnt-box">
						<div class="cnt-info">
							<p>This song, "Blood", has a different tone and message than "Sunny Day", the song I previously looked at. Both tracks have very introspective lyrics, but are distinct in meaning. Sunny Day focuses more the problems with people themselves, whereas I think Blood focuses more on the problems with humanity as a whole. No wonder why the album is titled "Humanistic". Before I start, this is just my own interpretation of the song, yours might differ, and mine might differ from what Walter originally intended.</p>
							<p>The first verse of the song starts after a slow fade in and some guitar notes: "I see the happy the family tree, It sways so easily, We're smiling all the time, This world just isn't mine". I interpret this first verse as describing volatility, putting on a face, and not fitting in with it. "I see the happy the family tree, It sways so easily" makes me think of mood swings and inconsistency. "We're smiling all the time", nobody smiles "all the time", leading me to think this actually means people are not happy. "This world just isn't mine", meaning not fitting in, or feeling hopeless in grand scheme of changing anything on a large scale.</p>
							<p>Leading up the chorus: "We watch it burn, And we never learn, This can't be what you're waiting for, Staring into the sun, We eat our young, This can't be what you're waiting for". This is where the song gets interesting for me: "We watch it burn, And we never learn", I think this is a direct reference to climate change, although "watching it burn" could also be a metaphor for any other type of destruction or societal collapse. "Staring into the sun", this line reminds me of the movie "Don't Look Up", it means the problem(s) are right in our face and are becoming harder and harder to ignore. "We eat our young", gets a little bit more ambiguous, but I think this is referring to the older generation having a disregard for the current youth, destroying the planet for their own gain and leaving the problem to younger generations when they will be long dead. Lastly, "This can't be what you're waiting for", this is fairly self explanatory. I think this line means the world and society starts to seem more and more of a disappointment as you grow out of adolescence, when you realize what it is and what it isn't.</p>
							<p>The chorus then starts: "Just take it easy on yourself, Forget all the stupid things we say, I know you beat up on yourself, I know, I know it's in your blood". The whole chorus is like Walter is consoling someone who is coming to terms with what he has already sung about. He is saying to not beat up on yourself or take blame on yourself for how stupid we as humans can be as a whole. Some of us realize what is wrong with society and we actively want to not partake in it and not contribute to the world's problems, those people will go insane from the ignorance around them.</p>
							<p>The second verse starts: "You say what no one understands, The seeds are in your hands, The branches break your bones, I can't just leave you alone, And watch you squirm". This second verse is another message to the people who are more self aware than the others. "You say what no one understands", visionaries are typically not understood at first, either that or the masses do not want to listen. "The seeds are in your hands", despite all of the ignorance and stupidity around us, you still have the potential to make change, anyone does. This line adds some sense of hope to the song, that not all is lost. "The branches break your bones", meaning getting beaten back into line by society. There is a saying in Japan about this: "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down". "I can't just leave you alone, And watch you squirm", becoming restless from these different realizations and coping with the current disarray of humanity.</p>
							<p>The chorus repeats, and then the bridge starts: "And I can't bring myself to look, I rip the pages from the book". Both these lines to me are screaming about the desire to return to the ignorance of adolescence where you can not mentally comprehend these things. This is ironic, considering in my analysis of Sunny Day one of the core themes of that song was why ignorance is bad, whereas this track almost embraces it as a solution because there is not much alternative.</p>
							<p>The same lines from before repeat once more, and the song slowly fades out. I can't overstate just how good Walter's songwriting is. Abandoned Pools, and this album are far from my favorite music, but yet I am so drawn to it just because of the stories and emotions he so effortlessly conveys through his lyrics alone. This album is from 2001, and as I mentioned in the Sunny Day article, these problems Walter is singing about have only worsened tenfold. This song could be easily applied to climate change, politics, war, or any other self deprecating activities humanity engages in (there are a lot).</p>
